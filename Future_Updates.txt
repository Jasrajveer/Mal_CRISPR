Some Improvements that will be implemented in the future are: 
  1) Implement scoring to proved a list of the best possible guide RNA sequences.
      * On/Off Target score 
      * Early Coding region
      * Amount of Activity
      * Common Sequences in Exon
      * Seperation if using multiple gRNAs for Gene Knockout
  2) Create a GUI for the program
